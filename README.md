# Favorites Contact Phonebook
This is a software program for managing your favorite contacts in your phonebook that I coded to enhance my python coding skills through implementing the use of  classes, Behaviour Driven Development and test_cases for Test Driven Development to build this software program.
I have coded this Favorites Contact Phonebook project in python3. Let's have a look at my work! :wave:

````Using git clone
git clone https://github.com/KyleGichez/Favorites-Contact-Phonebook
````
After cloning this project repository into your local machine, extract the files in the folder to access the code.
Yes! You did that? Let's get started: üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

### The challenge

You should be able to build a Favorites Contact Phonebook with the following features:

- Creates a contact.
- Saves a contact.
- Saves multiple contacts.
- Displays all contacts.
- Deletes a contact.
- Finds a contact by number.
- Exits the contact phonebook.

## My process

### Built with

- Python3

### What I learned

I have learned how to write test cases for Test Driven Development for my software program
```Python3
import unittest
from contact import Contact

class TestContact(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        """test create new contact instance"""
        self.new_contact = Contact("James", "Muriuki", "07122329112", "james@msn.com")

    def test_init(self):
        """test init contact"""
        self.assertEqual(self.new_contact.first_name, "James")
        self.assertEqual(self.new_contact.last_name, "Muriuki")
        self.assertEqual(self.new_contact.phone_number, "07122329112")
        self.assertEqual(self.new_contact.email, "james@msn.com")
```
I have also learned how to use the tearDown() method to check if all test cases for the saved phone number instances are equal when saving new contacts.
```Python3
 def tearDown(self):
        Contact.contact_list = []
```
The tearDown() method initializes the contact list to an empty list after saving a contact and checks if it has already been saved.
